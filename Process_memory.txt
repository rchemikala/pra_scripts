Use the following SQL to look at the smon background process we identified in the previous SQL and see its PGA memory allocations. 

SELECT spid, program,
            pga_max_mem      max,
            pga_alloc_mem    alloc,
            pga_used_mem     used,
            pga_freeable_mem free
       FROM V$PROCESS
      WHERE spid =



Category – Valid categories include "SQL", "PL/SQL", "OLAP" and "JAVA".
Allocated – Is the bytes of memory allocated to the process for a category.
Used – Is the current bytes of memory used by the process for the category.
Max_allocated – Is the maximum bytes of memory ever allocated for the category
Freeable - Is a special category that memory that has been allocated to the process but not to a specific category. This memory is available to be given back to the operating system. Interesting to note, there is no max_allocated value.
Other - Is a special category where memory has been allocated to the process but not to one of the default categories. Interesting to note, there is no used.

So, if you wanted to monitor the memory usage for our smon background processes in detail you could use the following SQL.

SQL> SELECT p.program,
            p.spid,
            pm.category,
            pm.allocated,
            pm.used,
            pm.max_allocated
       FROM V$PROCESS p, V$PROCESS_MEMORY pm
      WHERE p.pid = pm.pid
        AND p.spid = 2587;
