Failure to extend rollback segment because of 30036 condition w/auto undo mgmt

Please clarify correct resolution. I've reviewed Metalink docs # 269814.1 and 247184.1. 

One says solution is to increase UNDO file and UNDO_RETENTION param size, the other says to decrease the UNDO_RETENTION param size. 

My specs: 
(UR) UNDO_RETENTION in seconds 
(UPS) Number of undo data blocks generated per second 
(DBS) Overhead varies based on extent and file size (db_block_size) 

UndoSpace = [UR * (UPS * DBS)] + (DBS * 24) 

UPS = SELECT (SUM(undoblks) / SUM((end_time - begin_time) * 86400)) FROM v$undostat 


UR=10800 
UPS=13.5 
DBS=8192 
Calculate # bytes needed: 

SELECT (UR * (UPS * DBS)) + (DBS * 24) AS "Bytes" 
FROM (SELECT value AS UR FROM v$parameter WHERE name = 'undo_retention'), 
(SELECT (SUM(undoblks)/SUM(((end_time - begin_time)*86400))) AS UPS FROM v$undostat), 
(SELECT value AS DBS FROM v$parameter WHERE name = 'db_block_size') ; 

UndoSpace = 1198535374 bytes or 1.1GB -- but my current UNDO datafile is at 12GB (it's maxsize to extend) and I'm getting above error. Even when I calculate Max query length: 
SQL> select max(maxquerylen) from v$undostat; 

MAX(MAXQUERYLEN) 
---------------- 
57797 

Therefore using formula above, 
UndoSpace = [57797 * 110592] + 196608 
then UndoSpace min size = 6392082432 or 6GB -- I still have enough UNDO space (12GB) to accommodate the largest query. 

Other than requiring dev team to increase the frequency of commits, what can I do to calculate correct UNDO_RETENTION param value and UNDO size? 

thanx,
