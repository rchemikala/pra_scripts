To easily determine the current value of the highwater mark, use the following formula after analyzing the table: 

highwater mark = total blocks - empty blocks - 1 

Total blocks for a table can be obtained by using the following query. 

SELECT blocks
  FROM dba_segments
 WHERE owner = '&Owner'
   AND segment_name = 'Tablename';

Likewise, the number of empty blocks (blocks above the highwater mark) can be obtained with this query: 

SELECT empty_blocks
  FROM dba_tables
 WHERE owner = '&Owner'
   AND table_name = 'Tablename';
