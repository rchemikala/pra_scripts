hi ciaran
Doyle, Ciaran says:
Hello
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
this is rakesh from tcs dba team
Doyle, Ciaran says:
Hi
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
we need your help regarding script check_grow_new_us in pdw2
Doyle, Ciaran says:
OK
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
we are getting continuous alerts in pdw2 "Datafiles cannot accomodate next ext in  PDW2_MSC_TBL tablespace-add a datafile
"
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
even though we have free sapce of 6gb
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
in the tablespace
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
we have added 2 datafiles of 2gb each
Doyle, Ciaran says:
OK - here is simething to check - select * from dba_segments where tablespace_name='PDW2_MSC_TBL' order by next_extent;
Doyle, Ciaran says:
This us just in case there is some object with a massive next extent in the tablespace.
Doyle, Ciaran says:
Sometimes people craete objects whit PCTINCREASE not set to 0 and in this case the next segment just grows and grows
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
ok
Doyle, Ciaran says:
Any look?
Doyle, Ciaran says:
Any luck (that should be)?
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
most of them are not set to 0
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
pct increase is set to 50
Doyle, Ciaran says:
OK - but what is the biggest NEXT_EXTENT value if all the segments in that tablespace?
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
it is 1gb
Doyle, Ciaran says:
There you go.....what is the size of the table (the BYTES column)?
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
its 300MB
Doyle, Ciaran says:
OK.....set the NEXT_EXTENT to 20M and PCTINCREASE to 0 and run the check_grow script again to see if the alert comes
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
as these are red days we are not changing the storage parameters 
Doyle, Ciaran says:
This does not come under the remit of red days - you are not changing the data or evcen the table strucuture - just the amount of space that it is trying to allocate - having a table of 300MB with a next of 1 GB is not a good idea. 
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
ok 
Chemikala, Rakesh says:
thanks ciaran
Doyle, Ciaran says:
Not a problem
