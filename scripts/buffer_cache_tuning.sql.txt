/*Buffer Cache Performance Indicators
free buffer inspected' represents the number of buffer blocks
skipped to find a free one; buffer blocks are skipped because
they are dirty (contents modified) or pinned
The measure can be provided by Statspack or by the
following SQL query:*/


select name, value
from v$sysstat
where name='free buffer inspected'


/*the value is high or increasing, you should consider
increasing the buffer cache size*/
