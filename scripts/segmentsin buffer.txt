The following query counts the number of blocks for all segments that reside in the
buffer cache at that point in time. Depending on buffer cache size, this might require a
lot of sort space.
COLUMN OBJECT_NAME FORMAT A40
COLUMN NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS FORMAT 999,999,999,999
SELECT o.OBJECT_NAME, COUNT(*) NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS
FROM DBA_OBJECTS o, V$BH bh
WHERE o.DATA_OBJECT_ID = bh.OBJD
AND o.OWNER != 'SYS'
GROUP BY o.OBJECT_NAME
ORDER BY COUNT(*);
