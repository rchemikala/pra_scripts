Please use DBV to check the affected datafile and see if there are more corruptions:

dbv file=/uv1247/u292/oradata/NAGL2H/glddutility01.dbf blocksize=8192

You might need to change the blocksize if it's not 8K.

Unfortunately, since you are running in NOARCHIVELOG mode, we cannot use restore/recovery to fix the corrupt block. We have 2 options:

1. Restore the entire database from a cold backup taken before the corruption was seen. In this option, you will lose all data from the database which was modified after the cold backup.

2. Use event 10231 to salvage data from good blocks for table NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS. In this option, you will lose rows of table NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS which are part of corrupt block.

SQL> ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS '10231 TRACE NAME CONTEXT FOREVER, LEVEL 10';
SQL> create table NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS_NEW as select * from NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS;

Verify count(*) from NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS_NEW and NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS to estimate the rows lost. Once verified and found ok for application, you can then run:

SQL> truncate table NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS;
SQL> insert into NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS select * from NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS_NEW;
SQL> drop table NADDDBA.AUDIT_LOGONS_NEW;
