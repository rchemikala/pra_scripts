##Identifying Segments with High CBC Latch Sleeps  , This query shows that the top 100 cache buffers chains latches 

WITH cbc_latches AS
        (SELECT addr, name, sleeps,
               rank() over(order by sleeps desc) ranking
           FROM v$latch_children
         WHERE name = 'cache buffers chains')
   SELECT owner, object_name,object_type,
         COUNT(distinct l.addr) latches,
           SUM(tch) touches
     FROM cbc_latches l JOIN x$bh b
          ON (l.addr = b.hladdr)
     JOIN dba_objects o
          ON (b.obj = o.object_id)
    WHERE l.ranking <=100
   GROUP BY owner, object_name,object_type
  ORDER BY sum(tch) DESC;
